        We are a group in Oklahoma that wants to prtect our constitutional rights.
        <br>
        We are mainly focusing on our 2nd Amendment right which is the one that protects all other rights that we have.
        <br> 
        The members and those who support us are all active patriots that want to keep our freedom from being taken by those who try to infringe our rights.
